## One-Liner

Luna Agents is the only complete AI-powered development lifecycle platform, automating everything from requirements to post-launch monitoring for $29/month.

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Developers currently juggle 10+ tools costing $100+/month: GitHub Copilot for code, Jira for tasks, Playwright for testing, Vercel for deployment, DataDog for monitoring. Luna Agents replaces all of them with 15+ specialized AI agents in one platform for $29/month. From requirements analysis to production monitoring, Luna provides complete lifecycle automation that saves developers 10+ hours per week.

---

## Problem Statement

Modern software development is fragmented and expensive:
- Developers use 10+ separate tools ($100-300/month total cost)
- Constant context switching between platforms kills productivity
- No single tool covers the complete development lifecycle
- Indie developers and small teams can't afford enterprise tooling
- Existing AI coding assistants only handle code completion, not the full workflow

---

## Solution

Luna Agents provides the **first complete AI-powered development lifecycle** in a single platform:

**10 Core Agents** (Free tier):
1. Requirements Analyzer - Automatic codebase analysis and requirements generation
2. Design Architect - Technical design and architecture specifications
3. Task Planner - Dependency-ordered implementation plans
4. Task Executor - Code implementation with quality standards
5. Code Review - Automated quality and security assessments
6. Testing & Validation - Comprehensive test suite creation
7. Deployment - Production-ready deployment automation
8. Documentation - Auto-generated technical documentation
9. Monitoring & Observability - Complete monitoring stack setup
10. Post-Launch Review - Performance analysis and optimization

**5+ Premium Agents** (Pro tier):
- Luna UI Test - Automated Playwright UI/UX testing
- Luna UI Fix - Automatic UI issue detection and correction
- Luna Cloudflare Deploy - One-click global deployment
- Luna Vision RAG™ - Cloud-based GUI testing and analysis

- Pattern recognition and best practice extraction
- Vision-based screenshot-to-code analysis
- Context-aware code understanding

---

## Founder Story

[Founder Name], a [background], built Luna Agents after experiencing firsthand the frustration of juggling 10+ development tools while building [previous project].

"I was paying $150/month for GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Jira, Vercel, and DataDog - and still spending hours on manual tasks that should be automated," says [Founder]. "Luna Agents was born from the simple idea: what if one AI platform could handle the entire development lifecycle, not just code completion?"

Working nights and weekends while [day job if applicable], [Founder] spent [timeframe] building Luna Agents from scratch, leveraging cutting-edge MCP (Model Context Protocol) technology and Cloudflare's global edge network.

The result is a platform that democratizes AI-powered development, making enterprise-grade capabilities accessible to indie developers and small teams at a fraction of the cost.
