## Sales Objections & Responses

### "AI code isn't production-ready"
**Response**: "That's why we built Luna differently. Our Code Review Agent scans every line for security vulnerabilities. Plus automated testing and monitoring. Our enterprise customers deploy Luna code to production serving millions of users."

### "We already have developers"
**Response**: "Luna makes them 10x more productive. Your developers focus on architecture and business logic - the creative work - while Luna handles boilerplate, tests, and documentation."

### "What about vendor lock-in?"
**Response**: "Zero lock-in. Luna generates standard code. Export everything, run anywhere. We support GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket."

### "How secure is my code?"
**Response**: "SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, on-premise deployment available. Your code is encrypted at rest and in transit. We never train on your code without permission."

### "This seems expensive"
**Response**: "Let's do the math: If Luna saves 20 hours/month, that's $2,000 in value at $100/hour. Pro costs $29/month - **6,900% ROI**. Can you afford NOT to use it?"
