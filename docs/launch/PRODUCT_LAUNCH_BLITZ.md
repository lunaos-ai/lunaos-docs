Maker Comment:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Shahar, and I built Luna Agents after watching developers
(including myself) waste 40% of our time searching codebases.

**The Problem**: A simple question like "How does our auth work?"
takes 2.5 hours: GitHub search → read 3K lines → ask teammates.

**The Solution**: Luna searches your entire codebase instantly.
Type your question, get an answer in 30 seconds. With code examples.

**What Makes It Different**:
• 10 specialized AI agents (not one general model)
• Edge deployment (<50ms globally)
• Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 path, on-premise available)
• 100% production ready (deployed on Cloudflare Workers)

**Launching Today**:
• Free tier (100 queries/month)
• Pro at $29/month (saves you $2K/month in productivity)
• Beta feedback has been incredible (50 users, 9.2/10 NPS)

Try it free: [link]

Happy to answer questions! What's your biggest code search pain?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**First 10 Comments Strategy**:
- [ ] Prepare 5 friend accounts (upvote + comment)
- [ ] Answer all questions within 30 minutes
- [ ] Share in 10 dev communities simultaneously
