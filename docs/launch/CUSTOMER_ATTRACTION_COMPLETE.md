## 💰 Investor Pitch (2-Minute Version)

```
"We're Luna Agents. We automate development with 
20+ specialized AI agents.

[Show demo: screenshot → deployed app in 2min]

That's what took weeks, done in minutes.

1,200 developers using it. 500 apps deployed. 
Growing 35% per month.

We're raising $2M to:
1. Build Agent Marketplace (Netflix for dev tools)
2. Enterprise features
3. Expand to mobile/web3

The future of development is multi-agent.
We're building that future.

Questions?"

## 📧 Copy-Paste Marketing Templates

### Twitter Thread (Viral Template)
```
🚀 I spent 4 hours building a SaaS with AI agents.

It would've taken me 3 weeks manually.

Here's the complete breakdown:

(Thread 🧵👇)

1/ The Problem:
Building even simple SaaS takes forever.

Design: 2 days
Backend: 5 days
Frontend: 7 days
Testing: 3 days
Deploy: 2 days

Total: 3 weeks minimum.

There's a better way...

2/ Enter: Multi-Agent Workflow Automation

Instead of 1 AI helping you code, you get 
20+ specialized agents handling everything.

Vision RAG → Database → API → UI → Tests → Deploy

All orchestrated automatically.

3/ I built a complete subscription platform:
• User auth (JWT)
• Payment integration (LemonSqueezy)
• Analytics dashboard
• Email automation
• Global deployment (Cloudflare)

Time: 4 hours
Cost: $29/month

4/ Here's the crazy part...

[Continue for 15 tweets total with screenshots, code snippets, results]

15/ Want to try Luna Agents?

✓ Free tier: 5 agents
✓ Pro: $29/mo (all 20+ agents)
