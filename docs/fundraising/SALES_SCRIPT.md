## Opening (2 minutes)

**You**: "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time today! I'm [Your Name] from Luna Agents. Before we dive in, I want to make sure we use our time well. I have a quick demo to show you, but first - tell me a bit about what brought you to check us out?"

**Listen for**:
- Current pain points
- Team size
- Development speed issues
- Quality concerns
- Budget awareness

**Transition**: "Got it. Based on what you shared, I think you'll find this really relevant. Can I show you a quick 5-minute demo?"

---

## Problem Agitation (3 minutes)

**You**: "Before the demo - quick question: How long does it typically take your team to go from requirements to a production-ready feature?"

**Prospect**: [Answer]

**You**: "And how much of that time is spent on..."
- Writing boilerplate code?
- Creating tests?
- Reviewing code?
- Writing documentation?
- Setting up deployment?

**Prospect**: [Confirms pain points]

**You**: "Right. So what if I told you Luna can automate 70% of that work, letting your team ship in hours instead of weeks?"

---

## Demo (10 minutes)

### Part 1: Requirements to Code (3 min)

**You**: "Let me show you. I'm going to build a real feature - let's say a user authentication system with email verification."

**Action**: Share screen → Type requirements

```
Requirements:
- User registration with email/password
- Email verification flow
- Password reset functionality
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Security best practices
```

**You**: "Watch what happens when I hit enter..."

**Action**: Show Requirements Agent → Design Agent → Code Generator working

**You**: "In 30 seconds, Luna's agents analyzed the requirements, designed the architecture, and generated production-ready code. See this?" [Point to code] "That's TypeScript with proper error handling, input validation, and security built in."

### Part 2: Automated Testing (2 min)

**You**: "But here's where it gets interesting. Most AI tools stop at code generation. Luna doesn't."

**Action**: Show Testing Agent generating unit and integration tests

**You**: "Look - comprehensive test suite. Edge cases, error scenarios, integration tests. This would take a developer 2-3 hours to write. Luna did it in 20 seconds."

### Part 3: Security & Review (2 min)

**You**: "And before you deploy anything, the Code Review Agent scans for vulnerabilities."

**Action**: Show security scan results

**You**: "See - it caught a potential SQL injection, fixed the rate limiting configuration, and suggested password complexity improvements. This is the difference between AI code and AI + expert review."

### Part 4: Deployment (3 min)

**You**: "Now watch this - one click deployment."

**Action**: Show Deployment Agent setting up CI/CD pipeline

**You**: "Luna just created a complete deployment pipeline. Database migrations, environment variables, health checks, monitoring - everything you need for production. This typically takes a senior dev half a day to set up."

**Pause**: "So to recap - we went from requirements to production-ready code with tests, security scanning, and deployment in about 5 minutes. How long would this take your team?"

**Prospect**: [Response]

---

## Value Demonstration (5 minutes)

### ROI Calculator

**You**: "Let me show you what this means for your team specifically. How many developers do you have?"

**Prospect**: "[Number]"

**You**: "And what's their average fully-loaded cost per hour? If you don't know, I usually estimate $100/hour for mid-level developers."

**Prospect**: "[Number]"

**You**: *[Use ROI calculator]*

**You**: "Okay, so with [X] developers at [$Y]/hour, if Luna saves each person 20 hours per month - and we typically see 25-30 hours - that's **$[Z]** in value per month. Our Team plan for your size would cost **$[Price]**. That's a **[ROI %]** return on investment."

**You**: "But here's the thing - that's just time savings. What about:"
- Faster time to market?
- Fewer bugs in production?
- Consistent code quality?
- Easier onboarding for new devs?
- Less technical debt?

**You**: "Those are harder to quantify but equally valuable."

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "We need to try it first"

**You**: "Absolutely! That's why we offer a 14-day free trial. No credit card required. You can test it on a real project and see the results yourself. Would you like me to get you set up today, or do you have questions first?"

### Objection 2: "We need buy-in from the team"

**You**: "Makes total sense. Here's what I suggest - let's get 2-3 of your developers on a call. I'll do this same demo, answer their technical questions, and let them try it hands-on. Would next Tuesday or Thursday work better?"

### Objection 3: "We need to evaluate other tools"

**You**: "Smart approach. Can I ask - which other tools are you looking at?"

**Prospect**: [Names competitors]

**You**: "Great tools for code completion. Here's the key difference - [use comparison sheet]. Can I send you a comparison doc and schedule a follow-up after you've reviewed the others?"

### Objection 4: "Budget concerns"

**You**: "I get it. Here's the thing - Luna typically pays for itself in the first week through time savings alone. If you're not seeing ROI in 30 days, we'll refund you. But more importantly - what's the cost of NOT moving faster? If your competitor ships a feature next month and you ship it in 3 months, what's that worth?"

### Objection 5: "Security/compliance concerns"

**You**: "Great question - security is why we built Luna this way. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and we offer on-premise deployment for enterprises. Your code never leaves your environment unless you explicitly choose to share it. Can I send you our security whitepaper?"

---

## Closing (5 minutes)

### Trial Close

**You**: "Based on what you've seen, does this look like it could help your team?"

**Prospect**: "Yes" → Move to next step  
**Prospect**: "Maybe/Need to think" → Handle objections

### Next Steps - Pro/Team Tier

**You**: "Awesome! Here's what I suggest:
1. I'll send you a 14-day trial link - you can invite your whole team
2. I'll also send our onboarding guide and some example projects
3. Let's schedule a check-in call in 7 days to see how it's going

Does [specific date/time] work for the follow-up?"

### Next Steps - Enterprise

**You**: "Great! For your team size, I'd recommend:
1. Start with a 30-day Proof of Concept with 5-10 developers
2. I'll assign a dedicated success manager
3. We'll have weekly check-ins to ensure success
4. At the end of 30 days, we'll review results and discuss enterprise pricing

Does that sound like a good approach?"

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q**: "How does Luna compare to GitHub Copilot?"  
**A**: "Copilot is great for autocompleting code. Luna builds entire features - requirements, architecture, code, tests, deployment. Think of Copilot as a smart assistant, Luna as a full development team."

**Q**: "What languages/frameworks does Luna support?"  
**A**: "All major languages - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, PHP. Frameworks - React, Next.js, Vue, Node.js, Django, Spring Boot, and more. Basically, if a human developer can build it, Luna can help."

**Q**: "What if Luna makes a mistake?"  
**A**: "That's why we have multiple validation layers. Code Review Agent catches errors before they ship. Testing Agent verifies functionality. And your team still does final approval. We augment, not replace, your review process."

**Q**: "Can we customize Luna for our specific needs?"  
**A**: "Absolutely! Enterprise customers can train Luna on their codebase, create custom workflows, and even build specialized agents for domain-specific tasks."

**Q**: "What's included in support?"  
**A**: "Pro tier gets 24-hour email support. Team tier gets 4-hour chat support. Enterprise gets dedicated success managers and 1-hour response time 24/7."

**Q**: "How quickly can we see results?"  
**A**: "Most customers see value in the first week. By week 2, teams are typically shipping 2-3x faster. Full productivity gains show up around week 4 when the team has fully adapted to the workflow."
