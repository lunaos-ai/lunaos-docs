## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Product Risks

**Risk**: Product not ready for launch
**Mitigation**: 2-week intensive product readiness phase + private beta testing

**Risk**: Poor user experience
**Mitigation**: <5 min onboarding requirement + 50-100 beta testers

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Low launch traction (PH/HN)
**Mitigation**: Multiple platforms + pre-built community + content marketing backup

**Risk**: Competitors launch similar features
**Mitigation**: Move fast (8-week launch) + community moat + technical differentiators

### Execution Risks

**Risk**: Founder burnout
**Mitigation**: Realistic timeline + hire contractors for non-core work + community support

**Risk**: Feature bloat / scope creep
**Mitigation**: Stick to technical specs + MVP mindset + user-driven feature voting
