## 📧 Phase 3: Outreach Campaign (Week 3-6)

### Email Templates

**Template A: Warm Introduction**
```
Subject: [Mutual Connection] intro - Luna Agents (solving $1.2T dev crisis)

Hi [Name],

[Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out. I'm building Luna Agents - think
"Google + ChatGPT for enterprise codebases."

The problem: 15M developers waste 40% of their day searching for answers.
That's $1.2T lost annually.

Our solution: 30-second answers (vs 2.5 hours), 300x faster, 6,900% ROI.

Traction: 100% production ready in 6 months, $0 funding, enterprise-grade
security (0 vulnerabilities).

Raising $2.5M seed to scale from $0 → $2.4M ARR in Year 1.

Would love 15 minutes to share our demo and metrics.

Best,
Shahar

P.S. One-pager attached, full dataroom available.
```

**Template B: Cold Outreach (VCs)**
```
Subject: AI tools for developers - $47B market, 30:1 LTV:CAC

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Firm] invested in [Similar Company]. We're in the same space
but solving a different problem.

Luna Agents: Instant codebase search + AI answers (vs 2.5-hour manual search).

Quick metrics:
• Market: $47B TAM → $100M ARR in 3 years
• Unit Economics: 30:1 LTV:CAC, 1-month payback
• Traction: 100% production ready, 0 P0 vulnerabilities
• Ask: $2.5M seed at $12.5M pre

15-minute demo? [Calendar link]

**Template C: Cold Outreach (Angels)**
```
Subject: Developer productivity - 6,900% ROI tool

Hi [Name],

As a [former CTO/developer/relevant role], you know the pain: 40% of dev
time wasted searching codebases.

I built Luna Agents to solve this. 30 seconds vs 2.5 hours per search.

Built 100% production-ready platform in 6 months, solo, $0 funding. Now
raising $2.5M seed to scale.

Would value your feedback. 15 min? [Calendar link]

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Fundraising Risks

**Risk**: Takes longer than 60-90 days
- **Mitigation**: Keep burn at $0, extend timeline to 6 months
- **Backup**: Consulting/services while fundraising

**Risk**: Valuation too high ($12.5M pre)
- **Mitigation**: Flexible on valuation if partner fit is excellent
- **Floor**: $10M pre (25% dilution for $2.5M)

**Risk**: No term sheets after 50 meetings
- **Mitigation**: Pivot to smaller round ($1M-$1.5M) or SAFE
- **Backup**: Revenue-based financing (Clearco, Pipe)

**Risk**: Investor wants co-investor (syndicate)
- **Mitigation**: Positive (less dilution, more expertise)
- **Action**: Help lead find co-lead

### Founder Mental Health

**Fundraising is Exhausting**:
- [ ] Schedule breaks (1 day/week no meetings)
- [ ] Exercise daily (30 min minimum)
- [ ] Sleep 7-8 hours (non-negotiable)
- [ ] Talk to other founders (support group)
- [ ] Celebrate small wins (first meeting, term sheet)

**Expect Rejection**:
- Average: 50-100 "no's" before "yes"
- Don't take it personally
- Each "no" is closer to "yes"
- Ask for feedback (improve pitch)
