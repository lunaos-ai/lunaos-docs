# Getting Started with Luna Agents

**Time to Complete**: 15-20 minutes
**What You'll Build**: A complete feature from requirements to deployment

Welcome to Luna Agents! In this guide, you'll learn how to use AI-powered agents to automate your entire development lifecycle. By the end, you'll have completed a real project using Luna's intelligent agents.

---

## What is Luna Agents?

Luna Agents is a complete AI-powered development lifecycle platform that automates everything from requirements analysis to post-launch monitoring. Instead of juggling 10+ tools (GitHub Copilot, Jira, Playwright, Vercel, DataDog), you get 15+ specialized AI agents in one platform.

**Your entire dev team, powered by AI.**

### What You Get

- **10 Core Agents**: Requirements → Documentation (Free tier)
- **5+ Premium Agents**: UI testing, deployment, monitoring (Pro tier)
- **Luna RAG™**: Semantic code search that understands your codebase
- **MCP Integration**: Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and more
- **Global Performance**: Cloudflare-powered edge deployment

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- ✅ **MCP-Compatible Platform**: Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, or Zed
- ✅ **Node.js 18+**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- ✅ **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- ✅ **Terminal Access**: Command line / Terminal app
- ✅ **5-10 Minutes**: For installation and setup

---

## Step 1: Installation (5 minutes)

### Quick Install

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shacharsol/luna-agent.git
cd luna-agent

# Run automated setup
./setup.sh
```

**That's it!** The setup script will:
- ✅ Check prerequisites (Node.js, Git, npm)
- ✅ Install Luna RAG dependencies
- ✅ Configure MCP servers automatically
- ✅ Install Luna Agents plugin
- ✅ Update your MCP configuration
- ✅ Create quick reference guide

### What Gets Installed

**1. Luna RAG MCP Server** (Local semantic search)
- Indexes your codebase for intelligent search
- Pattern recognition and best practices extraction
- Natural language code queries

**2. Luna Vision RAG™ MCP Server** (Cloud-based, Premium)
- GUI testing and screenshot analysis
- No local process needed - runs in the cloud!
- Premium feature with API key

**3. Luna Agents Plugin** (15+ AI agents)
- Requirements analyzer, design architect, task planner
- Code review, testing, deployment automation
- Documentation, monitoring, post-launch review

### Verify Installation

After setup completes, **restart your AI coding assistant** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.).

Then verify everything works:

```
In your AI assistant, type:
"Use the health_check tool"
```

You should see a successful health check response from Luna Vision RAG.

### Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: ./setup.sh"**
- Make sure you're in the `luna-agent` directory
- Make the script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`

**"Node.js not found"**
- Install Node.js 18+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Restart your terminal after installation

**"MCP configuration not found"**
- The script will prompt you for your MCP config location
- Common locations:
  - Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Windsurf: `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/config.json`
  - Zed: `~/.config/zed/settings.json`

---

## Step 2: Your First Luna RAG Query (2 minutes)

Let's test Luna's intelligent code search. This works even if you don't have a project yet!

### Example 1: Understanding Your Codebase

```
In your AI assistant, type:

"Use Luna RAG to search my codebase: How does authentication work?"
```

Luna will:
1. Index your codebase semantically
2. Find all authentication-related code
3. Explain the flow and patterns
4. Show you the most relevant files

### Example 2: Find Coding Patterns

```
"Use Luna RAG to find all API endpoints in this project"
```

Luna will identify and list all endpoints with their methods, paths, and handlers.

### Example 3: Best Practices

```
"Use Luna RAG to show me all error handling patterns"
```

Luna will extract error handling approaches used in your codebase.

**🎉 Congratulations!** You've just experienced intelligent code search. This is just the beginning.

---

## Step 3: Complete Development Workflow (15 minutes)

Now let's build a real feature using Luna's complete agent workflow. We'll create a "User Profile" feature from scratch.

### Create a New Project

If you don't have a project, let's create one:

```bash
mkdir my-saas-app
cd my-saas-app
git init
```

### The Luna Workflow

Luna follows a proven development lifecycle:

```
1. Requirements → 2. Design → 3. Planning → 4. Execution →
5. Review → 6. Testing → 7. Deployment → 8. Documentation →
9. Monitoring → 10. Post-Launch
```

Let's walk through it!

---

### 1. Requirements Analysis (2 minutes)

**What it does**: Analyzes your codebase and generates comprehensive requirements

In your AI assistant:
```
/luna-requirements
```

When prompted for scope, type: `user-profile`

**What happens**:
- Luna analyzes your project structure
- Identifies technical constraints
- Generates detailed requirements document
- Saves to `.luna/my-saas-app/user-profile/requirements.md`

**Expected output**:
```markdown
# User Profile Feature - Requirements

## Business Requirements
- Users can view their profile information
- Users can edit their profile (name, email, bio)
- Profile pictures with upload capability

## Technical Requirements
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database schema for user profiles
- Frontend form with validation
...
```

---

/luna-execute  (Task 1.2 complete)
/luna-execute  (Task 2.1 complete)
...continue until done
```

**Expected output**:
Each run implements one task:
```
✅ Task 1.1 Complete: Created database migration
   - Created: migrations/20250101_add_profiles_table.sql
   - Added: Profile model with validation

```

### File Locations

All Luna files are in `.luna/[project-name]/[feature-name]/`:

```
.luna/
└── my-saas-app/
    └── user-profile/
        ├── requirements.md
        ├── design.md
        ├── implementation-plan.md
        ├── code-review-report.md
        ├── test-validation-report.md
        └── deployment-report.md
```

### Tips for Success

**1. Use Consistent Scope**
Always use the same project/feature name across commands.

✅ Good:
```
/luna-requirements user-profile
/luna-design user-profile
/luna-plan user-profile
```

❌ Bad:
```
/luna-requirements user-profile
/luna-design userProfile
/luna-plan user_profile
```

**2. Run Execute Multiple Times**
Don't expect one `/luna-execute` to complete everything. Run it 10-20+ times until all tasks are done.

**3. Check Reports After Each Step**
Review the generated documents in `.luna/` to ensure quality.

**4. Use Luna RAG First**
Before starting new work, use `/luna-rag` to understand existing code.
