## 🔮 Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Product Risks

**Risk 1: Product Not Ready for Launch**
- Mitigation: 2-week intensive product readiness phase
- Mitigation: Private beta to catch issues before public launch
- Mitigation: Rollback plan if launch goes badly

**Risk 2: Poor User Experience**
- Mitigation: <5 min onboarding requirement
- Mitigation: User testing with 50-100 beta testers
- Mitigation: Continuous UX optimization based on feedback

### Market Risks

**Risk 3: Low Product Hunt/HN Traction**
- Mitigation: Multiple launch platforms (don't rely on one)
- Mitigation: Pre-build community (beta users as advocates)
- Mitigation: Content marketing as backup distribution channel

**Risk 4: GitHub/Cursor Launches Competing Features**
- Mitigation: Move fast (launch in 6-8 weeks)
- Mitigation: Build community moat (loyal users)
- Mitigation: Technical moats (Luna RAG, Cloudflare architecture)

### Execution Risks

**Risk 5: Founder Burnout**
- Mitigation: Realistic 8-week timeline (not 2 weeks)
- Mitigation: Hire contractor for non-core tasks (video editing, design)
- Mitigation: Community support (beta testers become advocates)

**Risk 6: Feature Bloat / Scope Creep**
- Mitigation: Stick to technical specs (no additions during implementation)
- Mitigation: Post-launch feature voting (let users decide)
- Mitigation: MVP mindset (ship fast, iterate based on feedback)
