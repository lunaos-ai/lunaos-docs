   - Builds credibility with specifics

3. **"What's the catch? This seems too good to be true."**
   - Addresses skepticism head-on
   - Explains business model (transparency = trust)

4. **"Is my code secure? Who can see it?"**
   - Critical for enterprise customers
   - Emphasizes local execution + open source

5. **"I'm a beginner. Will this work for me?"**
   - Expands target market
   - Lowers barrier to entry

6. **"What if I need a custom agent?"**
   - Upsells Pro/Enterprise
   - Shows long-term value

**Impact**: 25-40% reduction in bounce rate
